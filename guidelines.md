General Guidelines:
-------------------
Don't change css casually. Everything's made with the idea of being responsive (has to look right from iPhone to big screen monitor) so be very careful when hardcoding stuff like margin values.

In css, its convention to use all lowercase. Don't do "Heading-medium". Use "heading-medium".

If you're adding new css rules, be sure to make a note of it.
