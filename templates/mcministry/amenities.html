      <h3>Amenities</h3>
      <p>The Amenities Committee is responsible for the improvement and upkeep of the public spaces (such as the lounges, TV room, game room, outside on 5th Floor, and hang-out area in the Commons) throughout McMurtry. We focus on creating a pleasant atmosphere throughout the college with rooms and amenities all students can utilize. The Amenities Committee strives to implement long-lasting enhancements that can be enjoyed by Murts for years to come!  </p>
