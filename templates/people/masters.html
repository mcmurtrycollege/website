<p>College masters are faculty members who live on campus with their families. We live right next to the college, across from the commons. We are here to foster the intellectual, cultural, and social life at the college and to support you during your years at McMurtry. This year, 2015, is our first year as masters, and we are excited to nurture the kind, open, and stimulating culture that has developed at McMurtry through the years. To do this, we will host events in our home, share meals with you in the commons, and help you navigate your life at the college. We hope that McMurtry will soon feel like your home away from home.</p>

<p>Margaret is an associate professor in the Psychology Department. Her specialty is applied psychology, and she studies performance in educational and work settings. She has been at Rice for 11 years, and loves mentoring the incredibly talented students she has met here. Chris is a high school math teacher at the High School for the Visual and Performing Arts (HSPVA) in Houston. He loves all sports and has been a high school basketball coach for the last 15 years.</p>

<p>We are both from Minneapolis, Minnesota and love the color purple (Purple Rain and the Minnesota Vikings). We met in high school and were married in Minnesota, but moved to Atlanta, Georgia shortly afterward for graduate school. We have two girls: Lucy, 13, and Liza, 11, who were born in Atlanta. Our kids are both in middle school and they love watching movies, reading books, playing piano, creating art, and swimming. We also have two boys: our German Shepherds, Oscar and Felix, who you will see walking Margaret around campus. We are all eager to welcome you to the college! </p>

  <!--<p>What are “masters,” you ask? Good Question.</p>

  <p>Masters are faculty members who live on campus with their families and contribute to the intellectual, cultural, and social life of their colleges. We are here to help you get the most out of your years at McMurtry and to help make the college as welcoming, stimulating, and supportive a place as possible.  We live right next to the college, across from the commons, and we look forward to hosting you in our home for events, gatherings, and receptions throughout the year. We hope that McMurtry will feel like a friendly home away from home. We’re also available on an informal basis to lend a sympathetic ear, offer guidance or advice if you need it, or make you aware of the university’s many resources—in short, to help you navigate your new life at Rice. Here’s a little about us: Karim teaches in the Shepherd School of Music, and is a composer, pianist and enthusiastic soccer player. Dereth is a lecturer and coordinator of undergraduate research in the department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and sings and draws for fun. Although our academic fields are music and biology, we love to talk with students about poetry, history, sociology, engineering, art, sports, languages, politics, literature, psychology, medicine, etc… you get the picture. Please join us at meals and tell us about your interests and your classes. We love to learn and hope that you will, too!</p>-->
