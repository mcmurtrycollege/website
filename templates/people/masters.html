  <p>What are “masters,” you ask? Good Question.</p>

  <p>Masters are faculty members who live on campus with their families and contribute to the intellectual, cultural, and social life of their colleges. We are here to help you get the most out of your years at McMurtry and to help make the college as welcoming, stimulating, and supportive a place as possible.  We live right next to the college, across from the commons, and we look forward to hosting you in our home for events, gatherings, and receptions throughout the year. We hope that McMurtry will feel like a friendly home away from home. We’re also available on an informal basis to lend a sympathetic ear, offer guidance or advice if you need it, or make you aware of the university’s many resources—in short, to help you navigate your new life at Rice. Here’s a little about us: Karim teaches in the Shepherd School of Music, and is a composer, pianist and enthusiastic soccer player. Dereth is a lecturer and coordinator of undergraduate research in the department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and sings and draws for fun. Although our academic fields are music and biology, we love to talk with students about poetry, history, sociology, engineering, art, sports, languages, politics, literature, psychology, medicine, etc… you get the picture. Please join us at meals and tell us about your interests and your classes. We love to learn and hope that you will, too!</p>
