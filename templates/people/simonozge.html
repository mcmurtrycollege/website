  <p>Welcome to McMurtry! Just like you, we are new Murts, and have only been Rice Owls for a little more than a year. We both teach in the Psychology Department where Özge focuses on how children learn language and Simon focuses on how old people lose it. We met in graduate school at Johns Hopkins and came to Houston after a short layover in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.</p>
<p>Baltimore was Özge's first time living in the US. She was born and raised in Balıkesir, Turkey, (which is on the Aegean coast near the side of Ancient Troy) and spent a decade in Istanbul (according to her the greatest city in the world). After spending almost a decade in the US, she finally feels at home here, but not so much so that she isn't still puzzled by some American obsessions, like root beer and baseball. She loves Houston because it is such a diverse city that she never feels like the "other". Part of that means that there is a huge Turkish community that provides good food and good friendship especially when she gets little homesick. </p>
<p>Simon is from a small town in Maine, once described by his college roommate (who is from Georgia) as "so far north, it is like the south, again". Ready to try something other than rural life, he moved to New York City (according to him, the greatest city in the world) for college and stayed afterwards for a couple of years. After living in Houston, he is almost ready to give up his Yankee roots, if only he could find a decent bagel. He loves Houston because it is such a disorganized multi-cultural mess, and there is always something new to explore.</p>
<p>We live here with our dog Coco, who is a rescue from a no-kill shelter in Houston (according to her the best city in the world). She loves meeting new people, especially adults, but gets a little nervous around new dogs and children. She is always happy to go for a walk or play, and you are more than welcome to borrow her.</p>
<p>We are going to spend this year figuring out this whole resident associate thing, but don't worry, we came prepared! Özge is the handy one; you can find her sewing, knitting, building, repairing and she would love to have a company in any of those. But like all most academics, she is a total nerd. She is a big fan of murder mystery/suspense novels, nature documentaries and Doctor Who.  Simon is the exploratory one; he is always looking for an interesting new spot, be it a restaurant, hiking trail or an art exhibition. He would love to organize little adventures to go on with students but can also be found in the servery reading the <em>New Yorker</em>. He loves non-fiction, Scrabble and pretty much anything that is on television. On a rainy day, you will often find us together in the room across from our apartment on the second floor watching Doctor Who (or some similarly awesome show) while Özge drinks tea working on some project and Simon drinks coffee working on the crossword. On beautiful days, we will be either reading on the quad or off exploring. Feel free to join us.</p>
<p>We are excited to meet you all and happy to help you with anything – advice on classes or majors, transitioning to college, suggestions for things to do in Houston. We are ready for an awesome year together and hope that you are too!</p>
